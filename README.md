## My process

In this challenge I only used HTML, CSS, and JavaScript didn't use any framework so as not to complicate the configuration

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- JavaScript

### What I learned

By working on this challenge, I was able to learn various important concepts in front-end web development. I will understand how to create semantic HTML structures, use Flexbox and grids for responsive layouts, and manage images and text well. Apart from that, this challenge taught me CSS applications such as the use of color, spacing between elements, as well as visual effects such as shadows and corner radii to create an attractive appearance, and I also learned the application of JavaScript which this time I used to open menu navigation when the page was located. on mobile layouts. Overall, it helped improve my understanding of responsive design and best practices in front-end development.
